# The peculiarity of this workflow is that assumes vcpkg stored as a submodule of 
# this repository.
# The workflow does the following:
# - Sets up vcpkg if needed, then run CMake with CMakePreset.json using a configuration
#   that leverages the vcpkg's toolchain file. This will automatically run vcpkg to install
#   dependencies described by the vcpkg.json manifest file. 
#   vcpkg's Binary Caching backed by GH Action cache is being used. It will be a no-op if 
#   dependencies are restored from GH Action cache.
# - Finally builds the sources with Ninja.
